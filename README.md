## CVEs

The National Vulnerability Database (NVD), maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), serves as a critical U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data. It forms a key component of the nation's cybersecurity infrastructure, providing comprehensive information on software and hardware flaws that could compromise computer security. The NVD aggregates and disseminates data based on the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), offering detailed records for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) for product identification, Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for categorizing software weaknesses, and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores to quantify severity. Accessing this rich dataset programmatically via its Application Programming Interface (API) is invaluable for organizations seeking to automate vulnerability assessment, integrate threat intelligence into security workflows, and maintain an accurate understanding of their cyber risk posture.

Please see CVE-API-Monitoring.txt for how to customize the API for your purposes.
